University Clinic Booking System

Welcome to the University Clinic Booking System project.
This repository contains the files for a website designed to help university clinics streamline their appointment booking processes.

Project Overview

The goal of this project is to provide a user-friendly and efficient web-based platform for university clinics to manage their appointments and reduce administrative burden. The system allows students and staff to easily book, modify, or cancel appointments with healthcare providers. It also allows clinic administrators to manage appointment slots and track the clinic's daily schedule.

Key Features:
- Online Booking: Students and staff can view available appointment times and book their appointments online.
- Appointment Management: Users can modify or cancel their appointments through the system, reducing the need for manual changes.
- Admin Dashboard: Clinic staff have access to a dashboard that shows upcoming appointments, daily schedules, and patient information.
- Data Security: All personal and medical information is encrypted and stored securely, in compliance with privacy regulations.
